  <h1>Analogies Between Bernoulli Process, Binomial Models, and Combinatorial Structures</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The present discussion highlights the conceptual and mathematical analogies between the Bernoulli process simulation
    used in the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) experiment and the random walk model based on binomial behavior from the
    previous homework. Both rely on sequences of independent binary outcomes, yet they differ in focus, objectives,
    and the interpretations of their resulting distributions.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Bernoulli Process and the Law of Large Numbers</h2>
  <p>
    A Bernoulli process consists of independent trials with two possible outcomes, often coded as success (1) or failure (0),
    each with constant probability <code>p</code> of success. The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states that as the number of trials <code>n</code>
    increases, the sample mean of these outcomes converges to the true probability <code>p</code>. Mathematically:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>lim (n → ∞) (1/n) Σ Xᵢ = p</code></p>
  <p>
    where <code>Xᵢ</code> are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. This convergence underpins the idea of empirical stability
    in probabilistic systems and serves as a foundation for statistical inference.
  </p>

  <h2>2. The Random Walk Analogy</h2>
  <p>
    In the previous simulation, each trial corresponds to a week in which the server remains secure (+1) or is breached (-1).
    The cumulative score after <code>n</code> weeks forms a <strong>random walk</strong> on the integer line.
    This random walk is algebraically equivalent to a shifted and scaled binomial random variable:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>S = 2K − n</code>, where <code>K ~ Binomial(n, q)</code>.</p>
  <p>
    This relation directly connects the random walk model with the Bernoulli process:
    both arise from sequences of binary outcomes, but while the Bernoulli process focuses on frequencies and convergence
    of averages (LLN), the random walk emphasizes cumulative deviations and distributional properties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Connection with the Binomial Distribution</h2>
  <p>
    Both frameworks yield binomial distributions for the count of successful outcomes. The binomial probability mass function:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>P(K = k) = C(n, k) p^k (1 - p)^(n - k)</code></p>
  <p>
    illustrates how the coefficients <code>C(n, k)</code> = <code>n! / [k! (n - k)!]</code> play a key role in weighting
    the number of ways to obtain exactly <code>k</code> successes in <code>n</code> trials. In both the LLN and random walk,
    these coefficients define the shape and symmetry of the outcome distributions.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Pascal’s Triangle and the Binomial Expansion</h2>
  <p>
    The coefficients <code>C(n, k)</code> form Pascal’s triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two directly above it:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>C(n, k) = C(n−1, k−1) + C(n−1, k)</code></p>
  <p>
    This recurrence mirrors the combinatorial logic of Bernoulli trials: any sequence with <code>k</code> successes in <code>n</code> trials
    can end with either a success or a failure, contributing to the counts recursively. The same coefficients appear in the
    <strong>binomial expansion</strong>:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>(p + q)^n = Σ C(n, k) p^k q^(n−k)</code></p>
  <p>
    which provides a direct algebraic representation of the probability distribution across all possible outcomes of <code>n</code> trials.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Fibonacci and Combinatorial Structures</h2>
  <p>
    Combinatorial coefficients like <code>C(n, k)</code> also have deep links to the Fibonacci sequence.
    By summing the entries along certain diagonals of Pascal’s triangle, one obtains Fibonacci numbers:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>F(n) = Σ C(n−1−i, i)</code></p>
  <p>
    This relation reflects how combinatorial counting principles underlie both stochastic and recursive numerical structures.
    The random walk itself can be interpreted as counting the number of distinct paths reaching a certain position,
    similar to how Fibonacci counts possible sequences under specific recurrence constraints.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Similarities and Differences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both models rely on independent Bernoulli trials with constant probabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both converge toward binomial behavior and are governed by combinatorial coefficients <code>C(n, k)</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Difference:</strong> The LLN focuses on the convergence of means, while the random walk focuses on cumulative sums and their distributions.</li>
    <li><strong>Difference:</strong> The LLN describes asymptotic stability, whereas the random walk reveals stochastic variability and dispersion.</li>
    <li><strong>Difference:</strong> The random walk interpretation emphasizes symmetry, variance, and probabilistic trajectories, while the LLN emphasizes expected values and averages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Mathematical and Conceptual Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The Bernoulli process provides the fundamental probabilistic mechanism; the binomial distribution quantifies its finite-sample behavior;
    Pascal’s triangle and binomial coefficients encode the combinatorial structure of outcome possibilities;
    the Fibonacci connection and related recursive relationships illustrate how probabilistic and combinatorial systems
    share deep structural analogies across mathematics and applied statistics.
