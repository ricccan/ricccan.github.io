<h1>Interpretations of Probability, Axiomatic Foundations, and Measure-Theoretic Structure</h1>

<h2>1. Main Interpretations of Probability</h2>

<h3>1.1 Classical Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The classical (Laplacean) interpretation defines probability as the ratio:
</p>
<p class="formula">P(A) = favorable outcomes / equally likely outcomes</p>
<p>
This interpretation requires symmetry or equiprobability​ and works well for games of chance.  
Its limitation lies in the fact that many real-world scenarios lack natural symmetry assumptions.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Frequentist Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The frequentist view defines probability as the limiting relative frequency of an event:
</p>
<p class="formula">P(A) = lim (n → ∞) N(A)/n</p>
<p>
This interpretation gives objective meaning but struggles with single-case events  
(e.g., “probability it will rain tomorrow”).
</p>

<h3>1.3 Bayesian Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The Bayesian approach defines probability as a degree of belief, updated via Bayes’ theorem:
</p>
<p class="formula">P(A | B) = [P(B | A) P(A)] / P(B)</p>
<p>
This interpretation handles subjective uncertainty and single events,  
but critics argue about the objectivity of priors.
</p>

<h3>1.4 Geometric Interpretation</h3>
<p>
Events are defined as subsets of a line, area, or volume. Probabilities are proportional measures:
</p>
<p class="formula">P(A) = measure(A) / measure(total space)</p>
<p>
This interpretation generalizes Laplace's framework but requires a well-defined geometric measure.
</p>

<h3>1.5 Propensity Interpretation</h3>
<p>
Probability is viewed as a physical tendency or disposition of a system to produce outcomes.  
Useful in quantum mechanics and physical sciences, but difficult to formalize rigorously.
</p>


<h2>2. How the Axiomatic Approach Resolves Inconsistencies</h2>

<p>
Kolmogorov’s axiomatic approach (1933) defines probability as a measure on a σ-algebra.  
The axioms are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Axiom 1:</strong> P(A) ≥ 0</li>
  <li><strong>Axiom 2:</strong> P(Ω) = 1</li>
  <li><strong>Axiom 3 (σ-additivity):</strong>  
    If A₁, A₂, … are pairwise disjoint, then  
    <div class="formula">
      P(⋃ Aᵢ) = Σ P(Aᵢ)
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These axioms solve conceptual issues:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>They do not assume equiprobability → resolves classical limitations.</li>
  <li>No limiting frequencies are required → resolves frequentist circularity.</li>
  <li>Does not rely on subjective priors → resolves Bayesian philosophical concerns.</li>
  <li>Compatible with geometric probability through measure theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, the axiomatic approach unifies all interpretations under a single consistent mathematical structure.
</p>


<h2>3. Probability and Measure Theory</h2>

<h3>3.1 Sigma-Algebras</h3>
<p>
A σ-algebra 𝓕 is a collection of subsets of Ω closed under complements and countable unions.  
It ensures that probabilities can be consistently assigned.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Probability Measure</h3>
<p>
A probability measure P: 𝓕 → [0, 1] satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms.  
Probability becomes a special case of a <strong>measure</strong> with total mass 1.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Measurable Functions and Random Variables</h3>
<p>
A random variable X is a measurable function:
</p>
<p class="formula">X: Ω → ℝ</p>
<p>
such that for every Borel set B:
</p>
<p class="formula">{ω ∈ Ω : X(ω) ∈ B} ∈ 𝓕</p>
<p>
This ensures that probabilities of events like X ≤ x are well-defined.
</p>

<h3>3.4 Expectations and Integrals</h3>
<p>
The expectation of X is the Lebesgue integral with respect to the probability measure:
</p>
<p class="formula">
E[X] = ∫<sub>Ω</sub> X dP
</p>
<p>
Thus probability theory is essentially measure theory applied to random phenomena.
</p>


<h2>4. Deriving Subadditivity</h2>

<p>
For any events A and B:
</p>
<p class="formula">P(A ∪ B) ≤ P(A) + P(B)</p>

<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>
Write A ∪ B as a disjoint union:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A</li>
  <li>(B \ A)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then by σ-additivity:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B \ A)
</p>

<p>
Since P(B \ A) ≤ P(B), we have:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A ∪ B) ≤ P(A) + P(B)
</p>

<p>
Subadditivity follows immediately for any finite or countable union.
</p>


<h2>5. Inclusion–Exclusion Principle</h//2>

<h3>Two Events</h3>
<p>
For events A and B:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)
</p>

<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>
Write A ∪ B as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A \ B</li>
  <li>B \ A</li>
  <li>A ∩ B</li>
</ul>

<p>
These three sets are disjoint, so:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A ∪ B) = P(A \ B) + P(B \ A) + P(A ∩ B)
</p>

<p>
But:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A) = P(A \ B) + P(A ∩ B)
<br>
P(B) = P(B \ A) + P(A ∩ B)
</p>

<p>
Adding them:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A) + P(B) = P(A \ B) + P(B \ A) + 2 P(A ∩ B)
</p>

<p>
Thus subtracting P(A ∩ B):
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)
</p>

<h3>General Inclusion–Exclusion</h3>
<p>
For n events:
</p>
<p class="formula">
P(⋃ Aᵢ) =
Σ P(Aᵢ) − Σ P(Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ) + Σ P(Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ ∩ Aₖ) − … + (−1)^{n+1} P(A₁ ∩ … ∩ Aₙ)
</p>

<p>This follows by generalizing the two-event proof via induction.</p>
