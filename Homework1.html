# Homework 1:  "What is statistics, and why can it be useful for cybersecurity"

Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field; research in statistics finds applicability in virtually all scientific fields and research questions in the various scientific fields motivate the development of new statistical methods and theory. In developing methods and studying the theory that underlies the methods statisticians draw on a variety of mathematical and computational tools.

Statisticians measure and gather data about the individuals or elements of a sample and analyze this data to generate descriptive statistics. They can then use these observed characteristics of the sample data to make inferences or educated guesses about the unmeasured characteristics of the broader population. These are known as the parameters. 

Statistics are vital in cybersecurity for risk analysis, threat detection, and performance measurement, supported by tools like SIEM systems, User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), and network analysis tools. These technologies collect and analyze security data to identify patterns, anomalies, and trends, providing insights for proactive defense and informed decision-making
