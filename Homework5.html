    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In statistics, <strong>measures of location</strong> (also called measures of central tendency) summarize the "center" or typical value of a dataset.
      <strong>Measures of dispersion</strong> describe how spread out the data are around that center. Both families of measures are required to understand a dataset:
      a single central value without a measure of spread is usually insufficient to characterise the data.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Common measures of location (central tendency)</h2>

    <h3>1. Arithmetic mean (sample &amp; population)</h3>
    <p>
      The arithmetic mean (average) is the sum of observations divided by the number of observations.
      It is the most commonly used measure of center.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      Mean (population): &mu; = (1/N) &Sigma;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N</sup> x<sub>i</sub><br>
      Mean (sample): \(\bar{x} = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Good for quantitative, symmetric data; used in many statistical methods (e.g., least squares).<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Efficient estimator under many models, easy to compute and to manipulate analytically.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Sensitive to outliers and skewed distributions.</p>

    <h3>2. Median</h3>
    <p>
      The median is the middle value when observations are ordered. For an even number of observations it is commonly the average of the two middle values.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">Median: middle order statistic (50th percentile)</div>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Preferred in skewed distributions or when outliers are present (e.g., incomes, house prices).<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Robust to outliers; reflects a typical value in skewed data.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Less efficient than the mean for symmetric, light-tailed data; harder to manipulate analytically.</p>

    <h3>3. Mode</h3>
    <p>
      The mode is the most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset. For continuous data, modes can be estimated from density peaks.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">Mode: argmax of frequency / density</div>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Useful for categorical data or to identify common values (e.g., most common category, common defect).<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Intuitive for categorical variables; unaffected by extreme numeric values.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> May not be unique; for continuous variables it is less well-defined and sensitive to smoothing choices.</p>

    <h3>4. Other location measures (brief)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trimmed mean:</strong> Mean after removing a fixed percentage of the smallest and largest observations (robust compromise between mean and median).</li>
      <li><strong>Weighted mean:</strong> Mean where observations have weights (useful when samples have different importances).</li>
      <li><strong>Geometric mean / Harmonic mean:</strong> Useful for multiplicative processes or rates (e.g., growth rates).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Common measures of dispersion (spread)</h2>

    <h3>1. Range</h3>
    <p>The range is the difference between maximum and minimum: <code>range = max(x) - min(x)</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Quick indicator of spread.<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to compute and understand.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Highly sensitive to outliers; ignores distribution shape.</p>

    <h3>2. Variance and Standard Deviation</h3>
    <p>
      Variance measures average squared deviation from the mean; standard deviation (SD) is its square root and is in the same units as the data.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      Population variance: &sigma;<sup>2</sup> = (1/N)&Sigma;(x<sub>i</sub> - &mu;)<sup>2</sup><br>
      Sample variance: s<sup>2</sup> = (1/(n-1))&Sigma;(x<sub>i</sub> - x̄)<sup>2</sup><br>
      Standard deviation: s = &radic;(s<sup>2</sup>)
    </div>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Foundational in inference, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression and many models assume or use variance/SD.<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Mathematically convenient; relates to least-squares methods; captures overall dispersion.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Sensitive to outliers; because it squares deviations, extreme values have large influence.</p>

    <h3>3. Interquartile Range (IQR)</h3>
    <p>
      IQR = Q<sub>3</sub> − Q<sub>1</sub>, the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles. It measures the spread of the middle 50% of data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Robust measure of spread when data contains outliers or is skewed; used to detect outliers (e.g., Tukey's fences).<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Resistant to extreme values; easy to interpret.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Ignores tails of the distribution; less efficient for symmetric, light-tailed distributions compared to SD.</p>

    <h3>4. Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)</h3>
    <p>
      MAD = median(|x<sub>i</sub> − median(x)|). A robust measure of variability often scaled by a constant (≈1.4826) to estimate SD under normality.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Robust alternative to SD for outlier-prone data.<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Very robust; simple concept.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Less efficient if data are normal.</p>

    <h3>5. Coefficient of Variation (CV)</h3>
    <p>
      CV = SD / mean. It is a dimensionless measure that expresses variability relative to the mean.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Comparing variability across datasets with different units or scales (e.g., comparing variation in different sensors).<br>
       <strong>Advantages:</strong> Unitless and comparable across datasets.<br>
       <strong>Limitations:</strong> Not defined if the mean is near zero or exactly zero; sensitive to translation of data.</p>

    <h3>6. Percentiles and quantiles</h3>
    <p>
      Percentiles (e.g., 10th, 90th) describe locations in the distribution and together can characterize spread and tail behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>When to use which measure — guidance and examples</h2>

    <h3>Symmetric, light-tailed data (approximately normal)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Arithmetic mean is efficient and preferred.</li>
      <li><strong>Dispersion:</strong> Standard deviation and variance are natural choices and integrate well with parametric methods (t-tests, ANOVA, regression).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Skewed data or data with outliers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Median or trimmed mean is preferable because they are robust to extreme values.</li>
      <li><strong>Dispersion:</strong> IQR or MAD provide robust measures of spread; do not rely only on range or SD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Categorical data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Mode (most frequent category) is appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Dispersion:</strong> Use frequency tables, entropy, or measures like diversity indices rather than variance/SD.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Comparing variability across datasets with different scales</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>coefficient of variation</strong> to compare relative variability when means differ, but be cautious if means are near zero.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Small samples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sample estimates can be noisy; prefer robust measures if outliers likely; use corrected sample variance formula (divide by n−1) for unbiased variance estimate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always report at least one measure of location <em>and</em> one measure of dispersion (e.g., mean ± SD or median + IQR).</li>
      <li>Look at data visually (histogram, boxplot, density) before choosing statistics — plots reveal skewness and outliers.</li>
      <li>For skewed/outlier-prone data prefer median + IQR or trimmed mean + robust SD; for roughly normal data prefer mean ± SD.</li>
      <li>Be explicit whether estimates are for the sample or population and which formula you used (e.g., sample variance with n−1 denominator).</li>
      <li>When comparing groups, use scale-appropriate measures (CV for relative comparison, absolute SD for absolute differences).</li>
    </ul>
